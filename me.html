				Hi! My name is Kaylin Shioshita. I'm a Junior and TAM major. I'm from Arvada, CO.
				I have a miniature schnauzer named Lani. I like being creative through photography and 
				doodling. I would love the opportunity to travel, but also I enjoy watching tv and
				listening to music from different parts of the world. I've had experience with html and 
				css from Web. I'm interested in graphic design and improving my web development skills. 
				I'm hopeing this class will help me increase my knowledge of web development and how
				to use additional developmnt tools.
